Algorithms/notes:

Files we need:
  driver.cpp
  display.cpp //(+ .h)
  tamagotchi.cpp //(+ .h) class definition etc
  text files with tamagotchi
  status bar

Classes needed:
    tamagotchi:
        name
        health
        mood
        hunger
        age
        money
        evolve

        functions:
            feed
            evolve
            game
            getters/setters

    items:
        medicine
            (+ 1 health)
        food:
            bread
                (+ 1 belly)
            candy
                (+ 1 mood, - 1 health)

Day: when user enters 'n'
    - 1-3 randomly belly
    - 1 mood
    - 1 randomly health

Game:
    Winner:
        + 1 mood
        + 1 token
    Loser:
        - 1 mood

Costs:
    everything is 1 token

Evolve!
    Day 1: egg -> MAX HEALTH = 10
    Day 5: rabbit -> MAX HEALTH = 13
    Day 15: potato -> MAX HEALTH = 16

Display:
    STATUS
    MENU

NOTES:
  (higher/lower mini game)?

Week of 4/16: Have protoypes with function definitions
  Mid-way goal: Begin report/driver implementation (if not already started)
Week of 4/23: Done
